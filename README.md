How the Project works :-

This project doesn't have an account creation system. To use the applicaiton enter dummy credentials to login into the application. 
  Do note those credentials down somwhere since they will be required to revisit the persisted data once you have logged out of the application.
  The user once logged on, has to create a store(necessary step). Once he's done creating the store, he is sent to home screen where he can create items for his store or see all the items that he has added in the past. The applicaiton also gives the user an option to modify existing items and delete them from the store.
